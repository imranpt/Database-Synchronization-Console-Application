# Java Database Synchronization Console Application

##  Project Overview

This project is a **Java-based console application** designed to simulate basic **database management and synchronization operations**. It allows users to create database files, compare databases, and receive alerts through a menu-driven interface.

This application was developed as part of a **university coursework / practice project** to demonstrate Java fundamentals such as:

* File handling
* User input handling
* Menu-driven programs
* Exception handling

##  Technologies Used

* **Java (JDK 25 – Eclipse Temurin)**
* **VS Code** with Java Extension Pack
* **Git & GitHub** for version control
